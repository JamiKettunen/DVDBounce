# DVDBounce
Creates a bouncing DVD logo behind your Windows desktop icons.  
I made this for fun once I found [this article](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/856020/Draw-behind-Desktop-Icons-in-Windows) and could not resist.  
As this is *very* much unfinished right now, I won't be providing binary executables at this time.

## TODO
* Transfer the rest of the settings to `Config.cs`
* Finish `ConfigForm` & make it functional
* Make work with an image background (without major lag)
* Copy other `TODO`'s from code to here :p
* Add more details here
